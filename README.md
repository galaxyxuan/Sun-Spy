Edit Note:

1. Mainstream browsers have restricted video's autoplay policy: video autoplay won't be activated unless the video is set to muted.
2. replace the video/video-day.mp4 and video/video-night.mp4 files to their correct resolution versions.
3. Change the two videos to be the same width and height (now one is in 480px one is in 450px)
